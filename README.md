# full-stack-development
It is a Development project

Since you need code for a full-stack project including frontend, backend, and database integration, I'll provide a basic structure and implementation using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. Please note that this is a simplified version, and you may need to add more features and error handling based on your specific requirements.

Frontend (React)
You can start with the provided ReactTailwindBoilerplate or set up a new React project using create-react-app. Then, structure your components based on the design references given.
